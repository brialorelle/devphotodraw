## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

equal <- create_groups(read.csv(file="sketchNames_all.csv", header=TRUE, sep=","), criteria_scale = "age", criteria_nominal = "condition", 
                       sets_n = 3, repetitions = 98)
table(equal$newSet)

tapply(equal$age, equal$newSet, mean)

table(equal$newSet, equal$condition)

write_csv(equal,"distribute.csv")
```


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
