Analysis 3: (Exploratory) How similar are drawings across sites?
Drawings made by older children may be more similar across sites when children are drawing from perception (vs memory). This could result in higher feature similarity. across sites between drawings made from perception vs. memory memory (6 years +)
Within a high-dimensional feature space (VGG-19 Layer 6 embeddings) known to reflect perceptual similarity, are average feature vectors of drawings from a given category (e.g., houses) from each site CLOSER together together  when kids are drawing from perception vs from memory?
Compute distance between average category vectors for each pair of categories (e.g., site1-house, site2-house) and for each task  (perception, memory)
Recompute same effects, while randomly assigning participants to site; use as baseline. 
T-test on baseline differences (P-M differences per category) vs.  site-differences (P-M differences per category)
How highly correlated are within-site & between-site LOO scores?

(jefan notes)
What distance metric makes sense to use here?
reflecting low image variation in photo cues in this study?
reflecting differences in sparsity between cue types? photo > verbal
need to think about how to control for image sparsity when computing similarity
