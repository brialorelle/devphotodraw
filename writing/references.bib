Starting from classic theories on child graphical development, we proceed to analyze them and provide our own views on the subject. We will also recount a number of relevant empirical studies that appear to validate our theory. Our belief is that emotion and self-expression through movement play a key role in the development of child art, and that this may be already visible during the scribbling stage of drawing.},

@article{Sasaki2016,
	Abstract = {This study examines children's abilities to identify a color-specific object by associating it with a given color. During the experimental sessions in preschool classrooms, 156 children aged 3--5 years were engaged in a drawing and coloring task. The experiment investigated whether the color of the object drawn by the child was congruent to the color that he/she had previously chosen. The results showed that children older than four years of age used object color knowledge to associate the given color with an object, suggesting that children acquire this ability at the same age that they learn to choose a typical color from a color-specific object. The developmental model of object representations is discussed on the basis of these results.},

@article{Villarroel2017,
	Abstract = {The studies regarding how the comprehension of geometric shapes evolves in childhood are largely based on the assessment of children's responses during the course of tasks linked to the recognition, classification or explanation of prototypes and models. Little attention has been granted to the issue as to what extent the geometric shape turns out to be an expressive tool that young children spontaneously use in their pictorial productions and also, whether or not methodological research approaches aimed at the examination of unprompted usage of geometric shapes in childhood may be useful regarding the study of the development of geometric thinking. This evidence provided by this study is coherent with the assumption that before starting primary education, internal representation of closed curves, quadrilaterals and triangles should have been developed by a significant number of children and, more interestingly, that young children's graphical expressivity appears liaised to their skill to depict two-dimensional geometric shapes.},
